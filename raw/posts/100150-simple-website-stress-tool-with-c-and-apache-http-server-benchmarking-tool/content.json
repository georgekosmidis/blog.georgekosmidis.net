  "Description": "<p>To be honest, I got bored trying to remember all switches and combinations of Apache&#8217;s benchmarking tool! Since I use it sort of rarely, I just wrapped it in a convenient -for me at least- app that I can use without having to remember or read anything!</p>\n<p>This is my simple implementation of a website stress tool that uses Apache HTTP server benchmarking tool to get results for any request. Just follow the link for my github account, download, build, and use <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p>",
