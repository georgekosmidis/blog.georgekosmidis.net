  "Description": "<p>A few days ago, I was searching for a way to export MS SQL schema of <b>all</b> databases of a server for backup and migration purposes. Although I found some tools, what I needed was a way to get stored procedures, functions, views, triggers and everything even if it was <b>encrypted</b>.</p>\n<p>Since I couldn&#8217;t find a way to automate this (<i>e.g. run it every night to backup schema of my server</i>),  I thought it would be a nice weekend project.</p>\n<p>",
