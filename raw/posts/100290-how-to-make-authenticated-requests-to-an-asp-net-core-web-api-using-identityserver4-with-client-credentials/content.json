  "Title": "How to make authenticated requests to an ASP.NET Core web API using IdentityServer4 with Client Credentials.",
  "Description": "<p>This is a guide on how to make requests to a protected resource using <em>Client Credentials</em> with the <a href=\"https://www.nuget.org/packages/IdentityServer4.Contrib.HttpClientService/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IdentityServer4.Contrib.HttpClientService</a> nuget package. The library is actually an <code>HttpClient</code> service that makes it easy to make authenticated and resilient HTTP requests to protected by <a href=\"http://identityserver4.readthedocs.io\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IdentityServer4</a> resources. Additionally, more features include automatic complex type serialization for requests / deserialization for responds (using <code>Json.NET</code>), caching of the token response to reduce load and an <code>HttpRequestMessage</code> factory that adds an &#8220;<code>X-HttpClientService</code>&#8221; header for logging/tracking between cascading API calls.</p>\n<p>",
