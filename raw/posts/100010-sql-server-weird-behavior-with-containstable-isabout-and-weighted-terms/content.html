<p>I came across the following weird behaviour in an ISABOUT query in SQL SERVER, that involves weight keyword and the final rank of the results. I want to describe that behaviour here, just in case some has a good explanation over it!</p>
<blockquote><p>
This posts assumes some basic knowledge of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/search/query-with-full-text-search?view=sql-server-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">querying with full text search</a> </p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The following bullets, are the sum up of the behaviour. Notice how the results are reversed as the weight value goes down!</p>
<ul>
<li>weight(1): RANK of KEY 1 is 249<br /><em>(results order 1,2,3)</em></li>
<li>weight(0.8): RANK of KEY 1 is 321<br /><em>(weight down =&gt; rank up, results order 1,2,3)</em></li>
<li>weight(0.2): RANK of KEY 1 is 998<br /><em>(weight down =&gt; rank up, results order 1,2,3)</em></li>
<li>weight(0.17): RANK of KEY 1 is 802<br /><em>(weight down =&gt; rank down, results order 2,3,1)</em></li>
<li>weight(0.16): RANK of KEY 1 is 935<br /><em>(weight down =&gt; rank up, results order 2,1,3)</em></li>
<li>weight(0.01): RANK of KEY 1 is 50<br /><em>(weight down =&gt; rank down, results order 3,2,1)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, from 0.2 to 0.17 ranking decreases and <b>results are messed up</b>! From 0.16 results are inverted (<em>the weight values that reproduce this behaviour depend on terms, columns searched, etc</em>).</p>
<p>Microsoft states <a href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142524(v=sql.105).aspx' target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> that the actual value of RANK is meaningless, but I am sure the results order isn&#8217;t! </p>
<p><strong>Reproducing the behaviour</strong></p>
<p>These are the exact queries that I used to reproduce this behaviour:</p>
<p><strong>QUERY 1 (weight 1):</strong> (Initial ranking)<br />
<pre><code class="language-csharp">SELECT * FROM 
CONTAINSTABLE(FullTextTable, FullTextColumn, 'ISABOUT ("weird" weight (1) ) ') 
ORDER BY RANK DESC, [KEY]</code></pre><br />
Results</p>
<pre>
   KEY   RANK
    1    249
    2    156
    3    114
</pre>
<p><strong>QUERY 2 (weight 0.8):</strong>  (Ranking increases, initial order is preserved)<br />
<pre><code class="language-csharp">SELECT * FROM 
CONTAINSTABLE(FullTextTable, FullTextColumn, 'ISABOUT ("weird" weight (0.8) ) ') 
ORDER BY RANK DESC, [KEY]</code></pre><br />
Results</p>
<pre>
   KEY    RANK
    1     321
    2     201
    3     146
</pre>
<p><strong>QUERY 3 (weight 0.2):</strong>  (Ranking increases, initial order is preserved)<br />
<pre><code class="language-csharp">SELECT * FROM 
CONTAINSTABLE(FullTextTable, FullTextColumn, 'ISABOUT ("weird" weight (0.2) ) ') 
ORDER BY RANK DESC, [KEY]</code></pre><br />
Results</p>
<pre>
   KEY   RANK
    1    998
    2    877
    3    692
</pre>
<p><strong>QUERY 4 (weight 0.17):</strong> (Ranking decreases, best match is now last, inverted behavior <u>for these terms</u> begin at 0.17)<br />
<pre><code class="language-csharp">SELECT * FROM 
CONTAINSTABLE(FullTextTable, FullTextColumn, 'ISABOUT ("weird" weight (0.17) ) ') 
ORDER BY RANK DESC, [KEY]</code></pre><br />
Results</p>
<pre>
   KEY   RANK
    2    960
    3    958
    1    802
</pre>
<p><strong>QUERY 5 (weight 0.16):</strong> (Ranking increases, best match is now second)<br />
<pre><code class="language-csharp">SELECT * FROM 
CONTAINSTABLE(FullTextTable, FullTextColumn, 'ISABOUT ("weird" weight (0.16) ) ') 
ORDER BY RANK DESC, [KEY]</code></pre><br />
Results</p>
<pre>
   KEY   RANK
    2    978
    1    935
    3    841
</pre>
<p><strong>QUERY 6 (weight 0.01):</strong>  (Ranking decreases, best match is last again)<br />
<pre><code class="language-csharp">SELECT * FROM 
CONTAINSTABLE(FullTextTable, FullTextColumn, 'ISABOUT ("weird" weight (0.01) ) ') 
ORDER BY RANK DESC, [KEY]</code></pre><br />
Results</p>
<pre> 
   KEY   RANK
    3    105
    2     77
    1     50
</pre>
<p>This of course causes major problems when you use a custom &#8220;word-breaker&#8221;, creating something like this:<br />
<pre><code class="language-csharp">CONTAINSTABLE(FullTextTable, FullTextColumn, 
      'ISABOUT (
            "wordA wordB wordC" weight (0.8), 
            "wordA*" NEAR "wordB*" NEAR "wordC*" weight (0.6), 
            "wordA*" weight (0.1), 
            "wordB*" weight (0.1), 
            "wordC*" weight (0.1)
      )'
)</code></pre></p>
<p>But for now, and until a better solution is found, I changed the algorithm of the custom word-breaker to always use weights above 0.2!</p>
