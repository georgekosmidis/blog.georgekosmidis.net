  "Description": "<p>Although running a parallel foreach that makes async calls is a pretty usual task, I found my self in a complicated situation, when async delegate calls got in the way!</p>\n<p>The situation arose while I was trying to write a <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.caching.memorycache(v=vs.110).aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MemoryCache</a> manager for my application (the manager was actually a wrapper of <a href=\"https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.caching.memorycache(v=vs.110).aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MemoryCache Class</a>).</p>\n<p>The following gist file, is a basic structure of what I was trying to do: Ask <code>MemoryCacheManager</code> for an item with <code>AddOrGetExisting</code> by passing a <code>key</code> to find the object and a generic delegate Func <code>task</code> that actually returns the object.<br />\n",
