  "Description": "<p>Before you actually start reading this article, I have to be honest with you: Unless your app is a Blazor app, you don&#8217;t need to read this; all you need is to download .NET 5, change the target framework in your project properties and that&#8217;s it&#8230;! Then again, if you need the download links or want to check the process I followed, feel free!</p>\n<p>",
