This is a helper class I wrote when I was asked to write an online lottery system.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind though, that for bigger numbers (above 100!) you will need <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary-precision_arithmetic\"target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Arbitrary-precision arithmetic</a>.</p>\n<p>Here is the code and please, if someone knows a faster way or has some suggestions let me now!</p>",
