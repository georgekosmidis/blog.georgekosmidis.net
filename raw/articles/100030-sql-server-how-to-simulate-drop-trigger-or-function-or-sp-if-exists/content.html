<p>I usually store triggers, store procedures, functions, queries etc in sql files in an SVN repository. I then use a simple app I wrote, that just opens each file and executes it. The problem of course is CREATE and ALTER. I can&#8217;t use CREATE because the same trigger might already be there. On the other hand I couldn&#8217;t use ALTER because some triggers might be new.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since there is no <code>DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS</code>, I came up with this:</p>

<p>Of course, &#8216;YOUR_TRIGGER_NAME&#8217; could be &#8216;YOUR_FUNCTION_NAME&#8217; or whatever! Just match it with the &#8216;type&#8217;. These are all the possible values of column type:</p>
