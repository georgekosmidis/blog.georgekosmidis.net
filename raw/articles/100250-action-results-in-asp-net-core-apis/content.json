  "Description": "<p>ASP.NET Core supports creating RESTful services, also known as web APIs. To handle requests, a web API uses controllers with actions (in essence methods) that return an <code>ActionResult</code>. Since an <code>ActionResult</code> can be almost anything (it&#8217;s like returning an object from your methods), it makes sense to know how to use it and when to choose to return a specific type instead.</p>",
