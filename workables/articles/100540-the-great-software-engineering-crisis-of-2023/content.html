<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The tech industry is facing a significant turning point in
	2022 and 2023 that caused widespread concerns and uncertainty about the future
	of software engineering jobs. Tens of thousands of employees were impacted as
	the industry experienced unprecedented layoffs. Amid this tumultuous time in
	the tech industry, Slalom stands out as a company that has taken a different
	approach to its employees.</p>

<h2>Some Layoff Statistics</h2>

<p>The tech industry saw significant layoffs in both 2022 and
	2023, with major companies like IBM, Google (Alphabet), Microsoft, Amazon, and
	Salesforce among those who cut jobs. In 2022, a total of around 160,000
	employees were laid off, while in 2023, over 75,000 employees were laid off,
	with the numbers expected to increase as the year progresses. Some notable
	layoffs in 2023 include IBM (1.5% of the workforce), Google (Alphabet) (6% of
	the workforce), Microsoft (4-5% of the workforce), and Salesforce (10% of the
	workforce).</p>

<h3>Hard numbers</h3>

<ul>
	<li>IBM mass layoffs: 3,900 people</li>
	<li>Google (Alphabet) mass layoffs: 12,000 people</li>
	<li>Microsoft mass layoffs: 10,000 people</li>
	<li>Amazon mass layoffs: 18,000 people</li>
	<li>Salesforce mass layoffs: 7,000 people</li>
</ul>

<h2>Reasons for the layoffs</h2>

<p>It could be tempting to just blame the pandemic slowdown and
	let it go but just recently, Microsoft, which laid off approximately 10,000
	employees, announced its plan to invest $10 billion in OpenAI, and Sundar
	Pichai, CEO of Alphabet, stated for the layoffs that "These are important
	moments to sharpen our focus, reengineer our cost base, and <strong>direct our
		talent and capital to our highest priorities</strong>"</p>

<p>Then what could the reason be?</p>

<p>It is known that the tech industry has experienced a surge
	in hiring during the Covid-19 pandemic, driven by record revenues and fierce
	competition for top talent. This has resulted in record-high salaries and media
	attention focused on extravagant perks offered by tech companies. However, all
	the massive hirings where not focused around the current text and code
	generative AI explosion but towards supporting and extending what was present
	before the pandemic. It is notable that with the recent lay-offs, the median
	time for an affected employee in their role is <strong>approximately two years</strong>,
	which could indicate a reversal of hiring policies put in place during the
	pandemic and a shift, as Sundar Pichai mentioned, towards higher priorities like
	Large Language Models. </p>

<p>One could also notice that the use of AI and automation in
	the hiring process has been on the rise in recent years. Platforms have been
	developed to automate routine tasks such as reference checks or identity
	verification during the onboarding process. Reports have even surfaced that
	companies like Amazon have used AI to identify low-performing employees and
	initiate termination procedures. The question arises thus, whether the
	advancements in AI and automation have created a scenario where the quickest
	way to save money is to replace human employees with machines. While no
	companies have directly stated automation as a driving force behind recent
	layoffs, the affected job roles and circumstances suggest that it may be a
	contributing factor.</p>

<blockquote>
	In total around than 160000 lost their jobs in 2022, and another 75000 in 2023.
</blockquote>

<p>At the end, while it is difficult to determine the exact
	impact of AI and automation on recent layoffs in the tech industry, it cannot
	be ignored that such advancements have played and will play a role in the
	current job market landscape. </p>


<h2>The impact of code generative AI on Software Engineering jobs</h2>

<p>The rise of code-writing AI tools like ChatGPT and Co-pilot
	have generated fear and uncertainty about the future of software engineering
	jobs, <a href="https://blog.georgekosmidis.net/the-dark-side-of-ai.html" target="_blank">but
		also of open-source code, community articles and more</a>. These tools are
	capable of generating boilerplate code, leading to concerns about the potential
	for automation to replace human software engineers, at least to a degree.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, despite concerns, experts believe that human
	software engineers will remain in high demand in the near future, and these
	tools will be valuable allies that assist with repetitive tasks such as writing
	boilerplate code, implementing best practices, and debugging or testing.
	Currently, AI tools for code writing lack the ability to produce creative and
	high-quality code and software engineering requires critical thinking,
	problem-solving, and communication skills that are exclusive to humans. </p>

<p>Although certain aspects of code writing can be automated,
	particularly those related to declarative languages, human software engineers
	are expected to retain a crucial role in the tech industry for the foreseeable
	future.</p>


<h2>The Future of the Tech Industry</h2>

<p>The tech industry has always been dynamic, adapting and
	evolving with new developments and breakthroughs. Despite the current crisis,
	the future of the industry is expected to be bright. As the economy recovers,
	demand for technology products and services is expected to grow, leading to
	increased investment in research and development, marketing, and staffing. This
	growth will provide opportunities for new technologies, such as AI and 5G, to
	emerge and drive innovation.</p>

<p>Moreover, the increasing adoption of AI and 5G technologies
	is expected to create new job opportunities in the tech industry. From data
	scientists and AI engineers, to 5G network specialists and cybersecurity
	experts, the growth of these new technologies will create a wide range of job
	opportunities for skilled professionals. As a result, most already believe that
	the tech industry will continue to be a major source of employment and economic
	growth in the coming years, providing stability and security for those in the
	industry and those looking to enter it.</p>


<h2>Slalom's Commitment to Employee Security During Economic Downturns</h2>

<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the company made the decision
	to <strong>not lay off</strong> any of its employees and instead found alternative
	cost-cutting measures. This commitment to its employees demonstrates Slalom's
	values and dedication to creating a supportive and stable work environment, and
	it extends beyond simply avoiding layoffs. The company recognizes the value of
	its workforce and the need to continuously upskill and develop its employees.
	To achieve this, Slalom has implemented innovative strategies to retrain and
	repurpose its workforce to meet the changing needs of the business. This
	approach not only helps to retain valuable employees, but it also ensures that
	the company has a skilled and adaptable workforce that can stay ahead of
	industry trends and changes. By investing in its employees, <strong>Slalom is able
		to maintain a competitive edge and create a positive work environment that
		attracts and retains top talent.</strong></p>

<blockquote>Slalom is a private company that places a strong
	emphasis on its employees! </blockquote>

<p>Testament to Slalomï¿½s brilliant navigation of the current
	stormy seas, is the expansion of its presence in new markets. The company
	already has a strong presence in 45 markets around the world, including the
	United States, United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and Japan, but its recent
	expansion into Germany marks the beginning of a European invasion, with plans
	to continue expanding into Ireland, the Netherlands and beyond. </p>

<p>Slalom is committed to continued growth and expansion, which
	requires a concerted effort to bring on new talent. In support of this growth,
	the company is currently engaged in an ambitious hiring initiative in Europe,
	with the goal of significantly expanding its workforce in the region. </p>

<blockquote>Just for Germany the company plans to triple the
	current workforce, with equally impressive growth goals for the rest of the region.
</blockquote>

<p>This growth sprint represents a unique opportunity for the
	company's 14,000 employees, who have been given the chance to grow and develop
	along with Slalom at a phenomenal rate. The company's commitment to its
	employees, coupled with its ambitious growth plans, creates an environment that
	is both supportive and empowering for all those who are part of the Slalom
	team.</p>
