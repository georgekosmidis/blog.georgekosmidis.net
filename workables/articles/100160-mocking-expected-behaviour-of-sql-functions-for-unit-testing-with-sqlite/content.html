<p>While unit testing, I came across a method in an SQL repository class that was using a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/raw-sql" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raw SQL query</a>, and along with that, SQL Server&#8217;s newid() function. Since the complicated reason behind this decision was out of scope, I had to find a way to unit test that method&#8230;</p>
<p>SQLite was -of course- the first approach, but any attempt to actually test the method would nevertheless fail with the exception <code>Microsoft.Data.Sqlite.SqliteException: 'SQLite Error 1: 'no such function: newid'.'</code>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To go around this, I used <code>SqliteConnection.CreateFunction</code> to bind a custom function to the connection and unit test SQL Queries that include that function (e.g. newid() )</p>
<p>You can see an example of this approach, in the following gist  <pre><code class="language-csharp">var options = new DbContextOptionsBuilder()
                  .UseSqlite("Data Source=:memory:")
                  .Options;
var context = new DemoProjectDbContext(options);

//open one and keep it, in-memory databases live untill the last connection closes
context.Database.OpenConnection();

var conn = context.Database.GetDbConnection() as SqliteConnection;
conn.CreateFunction("newid", () =&gt; { return Guid.NewGuid(); });
context.Database.EnsureCreated();

//Unit test code here...</code></pre></p>
