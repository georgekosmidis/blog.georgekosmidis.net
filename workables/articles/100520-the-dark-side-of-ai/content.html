<p>
  AI has the potential to negatively impact freely available, publicly available data such as blog posts, 
  code samples, and open source projects. One reason for this is that it can make it easier for people to 
  access this information without having to visit the original source.
</p>

<h3>The problem in Layman's Terms</h3>

<p>
 Imagine that a blogger writes a series of blog posts and shares them freely with the world. 
  These posts contain valuable information and code samples that are useful to many people. The blogger
   may offer this information freely because they hope to get some recognition and appreciation in return, 
   such as through website visits and thank you messages.
</p>

<p>
  However, if an AI system is trained on the data from these blog posts 
  and is able to provide answers to similar questions or tasks just as efficiently as the original blog, 
  then people may be more likely to use the AI system rather than visit the original blog. This could potentially 
  reduce the number of visits to the blog, which could in turn reduce the motivation of the 
  blogger to continue writing and sharing their content.
</p>

<h3>Probable solutions?</h3>

<p>
One potential solution could be to implement laws that forbid companies from training their AI systems 
with this type of data unless they have obtained written (or other) consent from the original poster. This could help 
to ensure that the creators of this type of content are fairly compensated and that their work is used ethically.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, legal bodies could explore whether privacy policies could be extended to 
include provisions related to the use of publicly available data by AI systems, so that a license of use 
must be explicitly acquired and its not implicitly assumed by the public nature of these data;
 something like the <i>'data protection by design and by default'</i> of GDPR.
This could help 
</p>

<p>
Another approach could be that open source licenses -such as the MIT license, Apache 2.0 license, and Creative Commons licenses- 
be modified to accommodate the use of publicly available data by AI systems. These licenses are
designed to protect the rights of creators and adapting them to address the use of publicly available data by AI systems
could help to rapidly and massively solve the problem, all around the world.
</p>

<p>
Finally, it is also possible that a new type of license specifically designed for 
blog posts and other forms of publicly available data could be "invented" in order to address this issue. 
This license will not be meant to replace all others, but rather to extend them, giving the creators the
possibility to choose weather to install it or not.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
In summary, AI has the potential to negatively impact freely available, publicly available data such 
as blog posts, code samples, and open source projects by reducing the incentive for people to create 
and share this type of content. This is because AI systems that are trained on this data may be able to 
provide answers to similar questions or tasks just as efficiently as the original source, which could potentially 
reduce the number of visits to the original source and the motivation of the creator to continue creating and 
sharing their content.
</p>
<p>
To address this issue, there are a few potential solutions that could be considered. 
One approach is to implement laws that forbid companies from training their AI systems with publicly 
available data unless they have obtained written consent from the original creators. Another possibility 
is to modify existing open source licenses, such as the MIT license and Creative Commons licenses, 
to include provisions related to the use of publicly available data by AI systems. Alternatively, a new type
 of license specifically designed for blog posts and other forms of publicly available data could be "invented" 
 in order to address this issue. Overall, it is important to carefully consider the potential consequences of 
 using AI and to ensure that it is used ethically and responsibly in order to avoid unintended
  negative impacts on publicly available data.

  And the plot twist? ChatGPT helped me write this article, but it wasn't a straightforward process. 
  There was no one question or statement that could lead directly to it. Instead, I had to find the right 
  questions and phrase them correctly, and even write paragraphs myself and ask ChatGPT to 
  reformat them to match the rest of the paragraphs.
</p>

<p>
  And the second plot twist? I asked ChatGPT to describe a potential feature image for this article, and then I fed that
  to Dall-E, which produced the feature image. 

  <blockquote>
    <b>Here is what ChatGPT returned. The two suggestions were fed separately to Dall-E</b> <br />
    "A potential feature image for this article could be a close-up photograph of a computer screen with an image of an AI system on it. 
    The image could be overlaid with text that reads "The Dark Side of AI" in bold, eye-catching letters. The background could be a dark, 
    moody color, such as deep blue or purple, to create a sense of foreboding and emphasize the "dark side" theme. Alternatively, 
    the image could be a stylized illustration of an AI system, with the same text overlaid on top. The overall 
    effect should be to draw the reader's attention and convey the theme of the article: the potential negative impact 
    of AI on freely available, publicly available data."
  </blockquote>

  Here is also a list of other images that Dall-E produced for the same article. Which one do you like more?
