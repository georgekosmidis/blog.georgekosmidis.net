<p>
  In this blog post, we will be comparing two important features in Azure: Scale Sets and Availability Sets. Both of these 
  features are designed to help you manage and scale your applications, but they work in different ways and are suitable for
   different use cases. Understanding the differences between these two features is important if you are planning to use Azure 
   to host your applications. In this post, we will take a deep dive into each of these features and compare them in terms of their 
   capabilities, use cases, and limitations. By the end of this post, you should have a clear understanding of which feature 
   is best suited for your needs.

<h2>Scale Sets</h2>
<p>
  Scale Sets are a group of identical, load balanced virtual machines (VMs) that can automatically increase or decrease in size based on demand. 
  This allows you to scale your application horizontally and handle more traffic without manually adding or removing VMs. Scale Sets are ideal for 
  applications that can scale out, such as web servers and batch processing systems. One of the key capabilities of Scale Sets is autoscaling,
   which allows you to automatically increase or decrease the number of VMs based on demand.
</p>

<blockquote>One of the limitations of Scale Sets is that they do not offer the same level of availability as Availability Sets. 
  If you need to ensure the availability of your application, you may want to consider using Availability Sets instead. </blockquote>

Here is an example of how you could use Bicep to deploy an Azure Scale Set:
<pre><code class="bicep">
  // Define the Scale Set resource
  resource scaleSet 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachineScaleSets@2019-03-01' = {
    name: 'myScaleSet'
    location: 'westus2'
    sku: {
      name: 'Standard_DS2_v2'
      capacity: 2
    }
    properties: {
      upgradePolicy: 'Manual'
      virtualMachineProfile: {
        osProfile: {
          computerNamePrefix: 'vm'
          adminUsername: 'admin'
          adminPassword: 'P@ssw0rd'
        }
        storageProfile: {
          imageReference: {
            publisher: 'MicrosoftWindowsServer'
            offer: 'WindowsServer'
            sku: '2019-datacenter'
            version: 'latest'
          }
        }
        networkProfile: {
          networkInterfaceConfigurations: [{
            name: 'nic'
            properties: {
              primary: true
              ipConfigurations: [{
                name: 'ip'
                properties: {
                  subnet: {
                    id: '/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnet/subnets/mySubnet'
                  }
                }
              }]
            }
          }]
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Define the Outputs
  output scaleSetId {
    value: resourceId(scaleSet)
  }
  
</code></pre>

And here is the same with Terraform:
<pre><code class="terraform">
  # Define the Scale Set resource
  resource "azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set" "my_scale_set" {
    name                = "myScaleSet"
    location            = "westus2"
    resource_group_name = "myResourceGroup"
    sku {
      name     = "Standard_DS2_v2"
      capacity = 2
    }
    upgrade_policy {
      mode = "Manual"
    }
    virtual_machine_profile {
      os_profile {
        computer_name_prefix = "vm"
        admin_username       = "admin"
        admin_password       = "P@ssw0rd"
      }
      storage_profile_image_reference {
        publisher = "MicrosoftWindowsServer"
        offer     = "WindowsServer"
        sku       = "2019-datacenter"
        version   = "latest"
      }
      network_profile {
        network_interface {
          name    = "nic"
          primary = true
          ip_configuration {
            name      = "ip"
            subnet_id = "/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/myVnet/subnets/mySubnet"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  
  # Define the Outputs
  output "scale_set_id" {
    value = azurerm_virtual_machine_scale_set.my_scale_set.id
  }
  
</code></pre>

Both sample will create an Azure Scale Set with 2 VMs, using the Standard_DS2_v2 VM size and the latest version of the Windows Server 2019 Datacenter image.
 The Scale Set will be placed in the <code>'westus2</code>' region and will have a manual upgrade policy. The VMs in the Scale Set will have a computer name prefix of <code>'vm'</code>, 
 an admin username of <code>'admin'</code>, and an admin password of <code>'P@ssw0rd'</code>. The output of both will be the ID of the Scale Set resource.
 (The samples assume a virtual network and subnet that you will need to create in advance)


<h2>Availability Sets</h2>
<p>
  Availability Sets are a group of VMs that are placed in different fault domains and update domains. Fault domains refer to the physical infrastructure 
  within a data center, such as racks and power supplies. Update domains refer to the groups of VMs that can be taken down for maintenance at the same time. 
  By placing VMs in different fault and update domains, you can ensure that your application remains available even if there is a hardware failure or 
  maintenance event.
</p>

<blockquote>
  Availability Sets takes the virtual machine and configures multiple copies of it.  Each copy is isolated within a separate physical server, compute rack, 
  storage units and network switches within a single datacenter within an Azure Region.
</blockquote>

<pre><code class="bicep">
  // Define the Availability Set resource
  resource availabilitySet 'Microsoft.Compute/availabilitySets@2019-03-01' = {
    name: 'myAvailabilitySet'
    location: 'westus2'
    properties: {
      platformFaultDomainCount: 2
      platformUpdateDomainCount: 2
    }
  }
  
  // Define the Outputs
  output availabilitySetId {
    value: resourceId(availabilitySet)
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This code will create an Azure Availability Set with 2 fault domains and 2 update domains again in the <code>'westus2'</code> region. 
The output of this code will be the ID of the Availability Set resource.</p>

<p>To attach a VM to this Availability Set, you will need to specify the ID of the Availability Set as the <code>'availabilitySetId' </code>
property when creating the VM resource.</p>

<pre><code class="bicep">
  // Define the VM resource
  resource vm 'Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines@2019-03-01' = {
    name: 'myVM'
    location: 'westus2'
    properties: {
      availabilitySet: {
        id: resourceId(availabilitySet)
      }
      ...other properties
    }
  }
</code></pre>

<p>This will attach the VM to the Availability Set, ensuring that it is placed in a different fault and update domain from the other VMs in the set.</p>

<p>In a similar fashion the following samples will create an availability set with Terraform</p>
<pre><code class="terraform">
  # Define the Availability Set resource
  resource "azurerm_availability_set" "my_availability_set" {
    name                = "myAvailabilitySet"
    location            = "westus2"
    resource_group_name = "myResourceGroup"
    platform_fault_domain_count = 2
    platform_update_domain_count = 2
  }
  
  # Define the Outputs
  output "availability_set_id" {
    value = azurerm_availability_set.my_availability_set.id
  }
</code></pre>

<p>And to attach a VM:</p>
<pre><code class="terraform">
  # Define the VM resource
  resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "my_vm" {
    name                  = "myVM"
    location              = "westus2"
    resource_group_name   = "myResourceGroup"
    availability_set_id   = azurerm_availability_set.my_availability_set.id

    ...other properties
  }
</code></pre>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>
<p>
  In terms of use cases, Scale Sets are best suited for applications that can scale out horizontally, such as web servers and batch processing systems. 
  They are not designed to ensure the availability of an application in the event of a hardware failure or maintenance event. On the other hand, 
  Availability Sets are designed specifically to ensure the availability of an application by placing VMs in different fault and update domains. 
  They are not designed for horizontal scaling like Scale Sets.
</p>

<blockquote>
  Fault domains refer to the physical infrastructure within a data center, such as racks and power supplies.
   By placing VMs in different fault domains, you can ensure that your application remains available even if there is a hardware failure or 
   maintenance event that affects one of the fault domains. For example, if you have an Availability Set with 3 fault domains and 
   you deploy 2 VMs in each fault domain, then at least 2 VMs will be available even if one fault domain goes offline.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  Update domains refer to the groups of VMs that can be taken down for maintenance at the same time. By placing VMs in different update domains, 
  you can ensure that your application remains available even if there is a planned maintenance event that affects one of the update domains. 
  For example, if you have an Availability Set with 3 update domains and you deploy 2 VMs in each update domain, then at least 2 VMs will be available 
  even if one update domain goes offline for maintenance.
</blockquote>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
  In summary, Azure Scale Sets and Availability Sets are both useful features that can help you manage and scale your applications in the Azure cloud. 
  However, they work in different ways and are suitable for different use cases. Scale Sets are best suited for applications that can scale out horizontally, 
  while Availability Sets are best suited for ensuring the availability of an application. It is important to understand the capabilities, 
  use cases, and limitations of these two features in order to decide which one is best suited for your needs.
