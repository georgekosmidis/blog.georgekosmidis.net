<p>Azure App Service Plans determine the resources and features available for your applications. Each tier offers different levels of CPU, RAM, storage, and additional features. Here's a breakdown of what each tier offers:</p>
<h2 id="free-tier">1. Free Tier</h2>
<p>The Free Tier is perfect for small applications and experimentation. It provides:</p>
<p>| Plan | CPU                              | RAM  | Storage |
|------|----------------------------------|------|-------- |
| Free | Shared (60 CPU minutes per day)  | 1 GB | 1 GB    |</p>
<p>This tier is ideal for developers who want to test applications without incurring costs. However, it comes with limitations in terms of performance and features.</p>
<h2 id="basic-tier">2. Basic Tier</h2>
<p>The Basic Tier offers more resources and is suitable for small production workloads:</p>
<p>| Plan | CPU     | RAM    | Storage        |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|
| B1   | 1 Core  | 1.75 GB| 10 GB Storage  |
| B2   | 2 Cores | 3.5 GB | 10 GB Storage  |
| B3   | 4 Cores | 7 GB   | 10 GB Storage  |</p>
<p>This tier is designed for applications that require more consistent performance than the Free Tier but do not need advanced features.</p>
<h2 id="standard-tier">3. Standard Tier</h2>
<p>The Standard Tier is a great choice for production workloads that require load balancing and auto-scaling:</p>
<p>| Plan | CPU     | RAM    | Storage        |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|
| S1   | 1 Core  | 1.75 GB| 50 GB Storage  |
| S2   | 2 Cores | 3.5 GB | 50 GB Storage  |
| S3   | 4 Cores | 7 GB   | 50 GB Storage  |</p>
<p>With support for custom domains, SSL, and daily backups, this tier is ideal for business applications that need reliability and scalability.</p>
<h2 id="premium-tier">4. Premium Tier</h2>
<p>The Premium Tier is tailored for high-traffic applications requiring enhanced performance and advanced features:</p>
<p>| Plan | CPU     | RAM    | Storage         |
|------|---------|--------|-----------------|
| P1   | 1 Core  | 3.5 GB | 250 GB Storage  |
| P2   | 2 Cores | 7 GB   | 250 GB Storage  |
| P3   | 4 Cores | 14 GB  | 250 GB Storage  |</p>
<p>This tier offers increased scalability, memory, and storage, making it suitable for large-scale applications with high availability needs.</p>
<h2 id="isolated-tier">5. Isolated Tier</h2>
<p>The Isolated Tier is designed for applications that need to run in a private, dedicated environment:</p>
<p>| Plan | CPU     | RAM    | Storage        |
|------|---------|--------|----------------|
| I1   | 2 Cores | 8 GB   | 1 TB Storage   |
| I2   | 4 Cores | 16 GB  | 1 TB Storage   |
| I3   | 8 Cores | 32 GB  | 1 TB Storage   |</p>
<p>This tier provides the highest level of isolation and security, ideal for mission-critical applications that require compliance and data sovereignty.</p>
<h1 id="making-the-decision">Making the Decision</h1>
<p>When choosing a plan, consider the following factors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Budget:</strong> Determine how much you are willing to spend. The Free Tier is cost-effective for testing, while the Isolated Tier offers premium features at a higher cost.</li>
<li><strong>Performance Needs:</strong> Evaluate the CPU and RAM requirements of your applications. Higher tiers offer more resources and better performance.</li>
<li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Consider whether your application needs to handle variable loads. The Standard and Premium tiers support auto-scaling.</li>
<li><strong>Security and Compliance:</strong> If your application requires strict data security and compliance, the Isolated Tier is the best choice.</li>
</ul>
