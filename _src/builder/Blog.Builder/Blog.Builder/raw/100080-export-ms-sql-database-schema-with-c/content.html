<p>A few days ago, I was searching for a way to export MS SQL schema of <b>all</b> databases of a server for backup and migration purposes. Although I found some tools, what I needed was a way to get stored procedures, functions, views, triggers and everything even if it was <b>encrypted</b>.</p>
<p>Since I couldn&#8217;t find a way to automate this (<i>e.g. run it every night to backup schema of my server</i>),  I thought it would be a nice weekend project.</p>
<p></p>

<p><b>Problem 1, automate script export:</b><br />
After some google search, I found out that 4 Microsoft SqlServer DLLs expose collections of all available objects in db: <code>Microsoft.SqlServer.ConnectionInfo.dll</code>, <code>Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Sdk.Sfc.dll</code>, <code>Microsoft.SqlServer.Smo.dll</code>, <code>Microsoft.SqlServer.SqlEnum.dll</code>.<br />
Now it was easy to get a server object and iterate every collection: </p>
<p><pre><code class="language-csharp">var cn = new SqlConnection( "...." );
var sc = new ServerConnection( cn );
Server server = new Server( sc );
foreach (var db in server.Databases.Cast&lt;database&gt;().AsQueryable().Where( o =&gt; o.IsSystemObject == false )) {
   ...
   foreach (Table o in db.Tables.Cast().AsQueryable().Where( o =&gt; o.IsSystemObject == false )) { 
      _SAVE ( o.script() );
   }
}</code></pre></p>
<p><b>Problem 2, encrypted objects:</b><br />
Again, after some google search I found that you can actually decrypt most of the info these object hold with a Dedicated Administrator Connection, also known as DAC. That means, that for sa logins only, you could enable DAC on a server, reconnect, get your encrypted objects and disable it again!</p>
<p><pre><code class="language-csharp">//enable it
cmd.CommandText = "exec sp_configure 'show advanced options', 1" + Environment.NewLine;
cmd.CommandText += "RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE" + Environment.NewLine;
cmd.CommandText += "exec sp_configure 'remote admin connections', 1" + Environment.NewLine;
cmd.CommandText += "RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE" + Environment.NewLine;
cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
//disable it
cmd.CommandText = "exec sp_configure 'show advanced options', 0" + Environment.NewLine;
cmd.CommandText += "RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE" + Environment.NewLine;
cmd.CommandText += "exec sp_configure 'remote admin connections', 0" + Environment.NewLine;
cmd.CommandText += "RECONFIGURE WITH OVERRIDE" + Environment.NewLine;
cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();</code></pre></p>
<p>That was it! The full working code that retrieves any encrypted object (as far as I know), along with the entire solution is on github: <a href="https://github.com/georgekosmidis/mssql-schema-dump" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/georgekosmidis/mssql-schema-dump</a></p><p>The post <a href="https://blog.georgekosmidis.net/export-ms-sql-database-schema-with-c/">Export MS SQL Database schema with C#</a> first appeared on <a href="https://blog.georgekosmidis.net">George Kosmidis</a>.</p>
