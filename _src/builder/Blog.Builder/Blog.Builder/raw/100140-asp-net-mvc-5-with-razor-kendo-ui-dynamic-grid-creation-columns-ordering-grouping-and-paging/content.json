  "Description": "<p>The requirements were simple! A grid that will load a whatever query, grouped by whatever columns, with filters enabled, paging and everything. Easy task with ASP.NET Telerik grids but not easy at all with Kendo UI!</p>\n<p>Since we can&#8217;t have a ViewModel or Model for the grid (we don&#8217;t know what columns a whatever query has!), I came up with a rather different ViewModel that holds descriptions for columns, groups etc&#8230;:</p>\n<p>",
