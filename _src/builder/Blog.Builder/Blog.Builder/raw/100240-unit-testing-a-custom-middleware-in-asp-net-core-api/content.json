  "Description": "<p>Middlewares are a fundamental part of any ASP.NET Core application, introduced from day one. They are executed in the order they are added on every request, and could be considered similar to the <code>HttpHandlers</code> and <code>HttpModules</code> of the classic ASP.NET. Since middlewares can execute code before or after calling the next in the pipeline, they are considered ideal for a ton of various application features, including exception handling, logging, authentication etc.</p>\n<p>",
