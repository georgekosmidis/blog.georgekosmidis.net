  "Description": "I usually store triggers, store procedures, functions, queries etc in sql files in an SVN repository. I then use a simple app I wrote, that just opens each file and executes it. The problem of course is CREATE and ALTER. I can&#8217;t use CREATE because the same trigger might already be there. On the other hand I couldn&#8217;t use ALTER because some triggers might be new.",
