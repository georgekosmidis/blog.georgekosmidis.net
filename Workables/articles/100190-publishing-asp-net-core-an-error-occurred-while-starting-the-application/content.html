<p>
It looks like this in your browser:
<br />
<figure class="figure">
  <img src="/media/100190-an_error_occured.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="An error occurred while starting the application." title="An error occurred while starting the application." />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">An error occurred while starting the application.</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>
Besides that one hint, that the error is while starting, it&#8217;s not very descriptive, right?
</p>
<p>
Althouth there many things that could go wrong and the proper way is to actually troubleshoot the error, I end up googling about this for over an hour! In my search I found numerous articles but it turned out that for me the solution was simple!<br />

<blockquote>I forgot to configure the release output path for swagger :/</blockquote>

<p>Probably you already know how to do this, but in case you don&#8217;t remember&#8230;:<br />
Right click your project, then click <code>Properties</code>, then click the<code>Build</code> tab and at the <code>Output</code> section check the <code>XML documentation file</code>:<br />
<figure class="figure">
  <img src="//media/100190-configure.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="An error occurred while starting the application - Configuration" title="An error occurred while starting the application - Configuration" />
  <figcaption class="figure-caption text-right">An error occurred while starting the application - Configuration</figcaption>
</figure>
</p>

<p>And if configuring swagger wasn’t the solution, you can either check one of the links below, or just <a href="https://scottsauber.com/2017/04/10/how-to-troubleshoot-an-error-occurred-while-starting-the-application-in-asp-net-core-on-iis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">troubleshoot your app</a>.</p>
