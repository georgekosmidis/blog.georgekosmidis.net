  "Description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.litedb.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LiteDB</a> is serverless MongoDB-like database delivered in a single DLL (less than 350kb) fully written in .NET C# managed code (compatible with .NET 3.5, 4.x, NETStandard 1.3 and 2.0). It is ideal for mobile apps or for small desktop/web apps, and its API is very similar to MongoDB C# Official Driver.</p>\n<p>In this post, we will see how to use <a href=\"https://www.litedb.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">LiteDB</a> as a storage for an ASP.NET API and do simple CRUD operations with it.<br />\n",
