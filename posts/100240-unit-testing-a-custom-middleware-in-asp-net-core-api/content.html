<p>Middlewares are a fundamental part of any ASP.NET Core application, introduced from day one. They are executed in the order they are added on every request, and could be considered similar to the <code>HttpHandlers</code> and <code>HttpModules</code> of the classic ASP.NET. Since middlewares can execute code before or after calling the next in the pipeline, they are considered ideal for a ton of various application features, including exception handling, logging, authentication etc.</p>

<p>Middlewares offer a powerful and flexible solution and for that, they need to be tested! Thankfully there is a way to do that so let&#8217;s first see what we are going to test and then just get in to it (middleware taken from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/middleware/write?view=aspnetcore-2.2" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Microsoft Docs</a>):<br />
<pre><code class="language-csharp">using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using System.Globalization;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

namespace Culture
{
    public class RequestCultureMiddleware
    {
        private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

        public RequestCultureMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
        {
            _next = next;
        }

        public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
        {
            var cultureQuery = context.Request.Query["culture"];
            if (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(cultureQuery))
            {
                var culture = new CultureInfo(cultureQuery);

                CultureInfo.CurrentCulture = culture;
                CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture = culture;
            }

            // Call the next delegate/middleware in the pipeline
            await _next(context);
        }
    }
}</code></pre></p>
<p>What it actually does is setting up the current culture using the query string from <code>HttpContext</code>. That is nice and useful, but <code>HttpContext</code> is notoriously difficult and dangerous to mock because it is so easy to take a direct dependency on it. I &#8216;ve even read somewhere that mocking <code>HttpContext</code> is like trying to calculate the last digit of pi: when you think you are done you &#8216;ll have more.</p>
<blockquote><p>HttpContext encapsulates all HTTP-specific information about an individual HTTP request. It is the biggest object made by man.</p></blockquote>
<p>To the rescue for this, we have <a href="https://github.com/aspnet/HttpAbstractions/blob/master/src/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http/DefaultHttpContext.cs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">DefaultHttpContext</a>. Nothing to mock, saved from messing up with login information, it&#8217;s there waiting to be used. The only thing to keep in mind is the <code>Response.Body</code> property. The <code>Response.Body</code> stream in <code>DefaultHttpContext</code> is <code>Stream.Null</code>, which is a stream that just <em>ignores all reads/writes</em>. No exceptions, no nothing if you use it, just a &#8220;talk to the hand&#8221; attitude! Solution of course, to setup the Stream ourselves before calling the method:</p>
<p><pre><code class="language-csharp">var context = new DefaultHttpContext();
context.Response.Body = new MemoryStream();</code></pre></p>
<p>Now that we found <code>DefaultHttpContext</code> and know how to use it, let&#8217;s just write a unit test to check the default current culture:<br />
<pre><code class="language-csharp">[TestMethod]
public async Task RequestCultureMiddleware_DefaultBehaviour()
{
    //Create a new instance of the middleware
    var middleware = new RequestCultureMiddleware(
        next: (innerHttpContext) =&gt;
        {
            innerHttpContext.Response.WriteAsync(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.TwoLetterISOLanguageName);
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    ); 

    //Create the DefaultHttpContext
    var context = new DefaultHttpContext();
    context.Response.Body = new MemoryStream();

    //Call the middleware
    await middleware.InvokeAsync(context);

    //Don't forget to rewind the stream
    context.Response.Body.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
    var body = new StreamReader(context.Response.Body).ReadToEnd();

    //'en' seems OK for me as the default
    Assert.AreEqual("en", body);
}</code></pre></p>
<p>Comments are relieving as to what is happening: We are passing a <code>RequestDelegate</code> as the next argument of the <code>RequestCultureMiddleware</code> constructor, that writes in the response the two letter ISO language name of the culture we set. In simple words, if the <code>RequestCultureMiddleware</code> works correctly all next middlewares in the pipeline after it, should have their culture set to whatever the user sent as a query string. </p>
<p>And let&#8217;s test exactly that now:</p>
<p><pre><code class="language-csharp">[TestMethod]
public async Task RequestCultureMiddleware_SetToGerman()
{
    //Create a new instance of the middleware
    var middleware = new RequestCultureMiddleware(
        next: (innerHttpContext) =&gt;
        {
            innerHttpContext.Response.WriteAsync(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.TwoLetterISOLanguageName);
            return Task.CompletedTask;
        }
    );

    //Create the DefaultHttpContext
    var context = new DefaultHttpContext();
    context.Response.Body = new MemoryStream();

    //Set culture to de-DE
    context.Request.QueryString = context.Request.QueryString.Add("culture", "de-DE");

    //Call the middleware
    await middleware.InvokeAsync(context);

    //Don't forget to rewind the stream
    context.Response.Body.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);
    var body = new StreamReader(context.Response.Body).ReadToEnd();

    //This time, 'de' should be the two letter ISO language name
    Assert.AreEqual("de", body);
}</code></pre></p>
<p>And that was it! Easy right?
